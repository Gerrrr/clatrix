# Clatrix matrix

A stupid name for a smart matrix library, because Clojure needs smart
matrices. Being implemented as a thin wrapper around the native BLAS
hooks of [jblas](http://github.com/mikiobraun/jblas) gives it
speed. Being implemented in Clojure makes it clever.

## Usage

For now, generate the documentation using `lein marg` and take a
look. A few examples of things you can do below.

```Clojure
clatrix.core> (let [A (matrix (repeat 5 (range 10)))] (pp A))
 A 5x10 matrix
 -------------
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  .  7.00e+00  8.00e+00  9.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  .  7.00e+00  8.00e+00  9.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  .  7.00e+00  8.00e+00  9.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  .  7.00e+00  8.00e+00  9.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  .  7.00e+00  8.00e+00  9.00e+00 
nil

(pp (from-indices 5 5 *))
 A 5x5 matrix
 ------------
 0.00e+00  0.00e+00  0.00e+00  0.00e+00  0.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  1.00e+00  2.00e+00  3.00e+00  4.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  2.00e+00  4.00e+00  6.00e+00  8.00e+00 
 0.00e+00  3.00e+00  6.00e+00  9.00e+00  1.20e+01 
 0.00e+00  4.00e+00  8.00e+00  1.20e+01  1.60e+01 
nil

clatrix.core> (time (solve (rand 1000 1000) (rand 1000)))
"Elapsed time: 158.216 msecs"
#<Matrix [1000 1]>

clatrix.core> (time (rank (rand 1000 1000)))
"Elapsed time: 13469.51 msecs"
1000

clatrix.core> (def A (rand 10 14))
#'clatrix.core/A
clatrix.core> (= A (c/t (c/t A)))
true
clatrix.core> (= A (hstack (cols A)))
true
clatrix.core> (def B (* A (t A)))
#'clatrix.core/B
clatrix.core> (let [{P :p L :l U :u} (lu B)] (= B (* P L U)))
true
clatrix.core> (let [P (rspectral 10) G (cholesky P)] (= P (* (t G) G)))
true
```
